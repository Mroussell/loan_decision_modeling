# Loan Decision Modeling

An Analysis, Modeling, and Prediction project that takes the [Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/#ProblemStatement) Dataset and preforms functional anaylisis to make prediction based decision models on loan acceptance.

## Purpose

To experiment and explore with decision based modeling and find anaylsis based predictions.
This project will work though a base introduction to modeling for decision based machine learning models for prediction loans.

## Set-up

To reproduce these analysis, models and predictions, follow the Jupyter Notebook in order step by step.
